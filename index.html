            <p>Hello, I'm Sam Palmer, a first year cybersecurity student at Staffordshire university. Computer science
                links strongly with my strength in Mathematics- I enjoy problem solving, starting on
                a problem and then working to find the solution. I enjoy the way aspects of computer science are
                logical and progressional, and find it interesting to expand upon patterns and sequences found in
                both mathematical concepts and computer processing.</p>

                <h3>I have completed</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A-level mathematics</li>
                    <li>A-level computer science</li>
                    <li>A-level physics</li>
                    <li>10 GCSEs</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <p>I have had an interest in technology since primary school; in ICT lessons, I was fascinated with the
                simple programming tools such as Scratch and Kodu that we used in class. Spurred on by the
                encouragements of my teachers, I then went on to study Computer Science at GCSE, further expanding
                my knowledge and sparking my curiosity and eventually leading to independently researching,
                planning, and building my own computer. Since then, I have upgraded both my own and a friend's
                computer.</p>

            <p>Through my Computer Science GCSE, I learnt to program in Visual Basic and completed two
                projects, a mathematics-based population simulation and a simple graphical game, which laid the
                foundation for learning another programming language, Python, and undertaking another, more complex,
                project at A level- an app designed to provide day-to-day assistance with simple tasks including
                weather and reminder functions. Despite this, most of my knowledge is self-taught, from reading
                blogs, articles, and books in my free time.</p>

            <p>During my Computer Science A-Level I have learnt to take a measured and logical approach to problems,
                which allows me to easily tackle new challenges. Although I have not personally studied Decision
                Maths in my Mathematics A-Level, many of my friends did. Seeing their use of algorithms and complex
                problem-solving inspired me to try to learn to solve the Rubik's cube - a task I am still working on
                to this day- demonstrating my initiative, perseverance and independence. My Physics A-Level has
                taught me to be curious about the world around me and has given me valuable research and
                experimental skills, allowing me to apply these skills in the real world and in my other subjects.

            <p>When I was 15, I discovered the website of security
                blogger Troy Hunt following the VTech data breach and quickly became an avid reader, inspiring me to
                read further about the topics discussed in his posts and ultimately motivated me to pursue a career
                in cybersecurity. Since then, I have become an avid reader of the technology magazine Wired, which
                often reports on security and forensics issues and attempts to deconstruct these problems and
                suggest practical solutions, which interests me greatly and proves that a career in this field would
                be both challenging and rewarding.</p>

            <p>In 2017, I completed the National Citizen Service alongside a team of people I had not previously
                met. This experience boosted my confidence and reinforced my teamwork abilities as my team and I
                organised and promoted a charity fun day in aid of Hope House Hospice, raising over Â£200 for the
                charity. Last year I was a part of the LGBT society in my college, further encouraging me to engage
                in discussions, debates, and projects with my peers, and this year I am leading the society, giving
                me responsibilities such as planning and running meetings. I have particularly enjoyed being able to
                meet new people from a diverse range of backgrounds, standing up for issues I believe in-
                particularly equality issues- and supporting and educating other students on key issues such as
                sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.</p>
