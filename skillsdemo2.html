            <article>
                <h3>At a minimum, a PC must contain:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A motherboard</li>
                    <li>A CPU</li>
                    <li>Primary storage (RAM)</li>
                    <li>Secondary storage</li>
                    <li>A case</li>
                    <li>A power supply</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <p>Additionally, a PC must include cooling and graphics output, though a CPU cooler is almost always
                included with new CPU purchases, and additional cooling fans are often included in the case. Many
                modern CPUs can provide onboard graphics, though some do not and a dedicated graphics card would be
                required.</p>

            <p>The motherboard allows the components to communicate, and also serves as a mounting point for some
                such as the CPU and its cooler, and RAM. A modern motherboard would include SATA ports, PCI express
                slots, an
                internal USB header to allow for front panel USB ports, fan headers, one or more DIMM ranks, and
                power connectors including the standard 24-pin main power supply connector and the 8 pin CPU power
                connector. A ROM chip is used to store the BIOS, though modern motherboards use UEFI, which is more
                flexible, and newer chips can be rewritable to allow for firmware updates. </p>

        <section>
            <h2 class="contentHeader">CPU & Storage</h2>
            <picture class="contentImage">

            <p>The CPU, or central processing unit, handles basic intructions and allocates resources.</p>

            <p>Random access memory (RAM) is a volatile storage used to store working memory, such as operating
                system data and running programs. Modern RAM is DDR4 type, though earlier versions are still in use
                and readily obtainable. DDR versions are not backwards compatible. RAM sticks are typically
                installed in DIMM ranks in pairs, to take advantage of dual-channel access, though this is not a
                requirement and just one stick can be installed. Care must be taken to ensure that a pair are
                installed in matching slots â€“ these are often colour coded or labelled and usually alternate.</p>

            <p>Secondary storage is not required for a PC to power on, though only the BIOS will be accessible
                without an operating system to load. This may be useful for testing that all other essential
                components are working correctly before installing the PC in a case, as the hard drive slots are
                often located in a separate compartment in the case. In modern PC builds, secondary storage is
                provided in the form of a mechanical hard disk, or a faster solid state drive.</p>

        <!--THIRD SECTION-->
        <section>
            <h2 class="contentHeader">Case & power supply</h2>

            <p>The case, or chassis, houses the internal components and helps to direct airflow. Cases are typically
                made from aluminium or steel, with acrylic or tempered glass windows.</p>

            <p>Power supplies are available in various efficiency ratings and power ratings. The power rating
                describes the maximum power output in watts, typically ranging from 300-1000W. The system power draw
                is calculated by adding the power draws of each component together and ensuring the power supply
                output exceeds this. Many parts manufacturers overestimate their power draw to minimise the
                potential of insufficient power. Efficiency is rated using the 80 plus certification, ranging from
                bronze to titanium, up to 94% efficiency.</p>
